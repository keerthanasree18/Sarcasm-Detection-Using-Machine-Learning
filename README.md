# Sarcasm-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project analyzes text using TextBlob for sentiment features and a Gaussian Naive Bayes model for classification. It extracts polarity, subjectivity, and n-gram sentiment scores to determine sarcasm levels. The model is trained on a dataset, evaluated using k-fold validation, and outputs sarcasm probabilities for test sentences.
